#### 1. Ease of Use
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Provides a simplified, conventions-over-configuration, opinionated framework.
    - _Cons_: Can be complex for beginners due to its wide array of configurations.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Known for its "batteries-included" philosophy.
    - _Cons_: Can be a bit too large for simple applications due to its inclusive philosophy.

#### 2. Community and Documentation
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Strong and active community, robust documentation.
    - _Cons_: Can be difficult to navigate due to numerous options and configurations.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Extensive documentation, active community.
    - _Cons_: Some plugins or extensions might lack comprehensive documentation.

#### 3. Security
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Wide range of security features, robust security for enterprise applications.
    - _Cons_: Security configuration can be complex.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Provides out-of-the-box support for many security features.
    - _Cons_: Might require additional configurations for extremely security-sensitive applications.

#### 4. REST API Development
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Easily exposes data models via REST.
    - _Cons_: Flexibility in designing API might be limited.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Great flexibility in designing APIs, provides functionalities like serialization.
    - _Cons_: Might require additional configurations for more complex API needs.

#### 5. Scalability
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Excellent scalability.
    - _Cons_: May introduce higher resource consumption due to extensive feature set.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Relatively lightweight, scalable.
    - _Cons_: Some argue it's not as naturally suited to very large-scale applications.

#### 6. Database Support and ORM
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Powerful ORM with JPA, supports a wide range of databases.
    - _Cons_: Initial setup of JPA can be complex for newcomers.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: High-level, easy-to-use ORM.
    - _Cons_: Advanced users might find Djangoâ€™s ORM to be limiting in certain complex use cases.

#### 7. Development Speed
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Accelerates development speed for standard applications.
    - _Cons_: Learning curve might slow initial development.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Facilitates rapid development due to simplicity.
    - _Cons_: The "Django way" might require more customization for extremely specialized use cases.

#### 8. Testing
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Provides a strong testing framework, supporting various testing methodologies.
    - _Cons_: Some testing configurations can be verbose.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Offers a user-friendly testing framework.
    - _Cons_: Can be limiting for developers wishing to utilize extensive testing libraries.

#### 9. API Maturity and HATEOAS Compliance
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Adheres to HATEOAS, facilitating API discoverability and evolution.
    - _Cons_: Developers might face a learning curve understanding HATEOAS.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Developers have flexibility to design APIs as per requirements.
    - _Cons_: Implementing HATEOAS-compliant API might demand additional effort.

#### 10. Automated API Exposure
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Automatically exposes model repositories as HTTP endpoints.
    - _Cons_: Limited ability to customize API endpoints.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Granular control over endpoint logic.
    - _Cons_: More manual setup is required.

#### 11. Data Validation and Serialization
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Automatically handles serialization/deserialization.
    - _Cons_: May need additional configuration for complex serialization logic.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Provides robust and flexible serialization framework.
    - _Cons_: Potential complexity in scenarios where API logic is straightforward.

#### 12. Integration with Front-end Frameworks
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Can be seamlessly integrated with various front-end frameworks.
    - _Cons_: Responses might be seen as verbose for clients that don't utilize HATEOAS.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: DRF-YASG and drf-spectacular enable easy API consumption from various front-end frameworks.
    - _Cons_: Might demand manual configuration and thorough documentation.

#### 13. Microservices Architecture
- **Spring Boot + Spring Data Rest**
    - _Pros_: Aligns well with microservices architecture and is considered cloud-native.
    - _Cons_: Building microservices with Spring may introduce complexity.
- **Django**
    - _Pros_: Simpler to set up for smaller applications or microservices.
    - _Cons_: Does not natively provide comprehensive tools and support for microservices.
